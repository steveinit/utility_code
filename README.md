# utility_code
 Electrical/water/other residential utilities

## Usage Order
1. Calculate the CAGR for your power grid over a period (at least 15 years) with calculate_gridCAGR.py
2. Calculate estimates to inform decision to stay on solely grid or go solar with calculate_solarPayback.py

## Roadmap
Im moving these into Lambda and putting a frontend on it for ease of use.
Feel free to take anything from here or hit my API endpoints (rate limited). The lambda code here may or may not be up to date, but I'll try to keep the sample curl up to date for reference.
